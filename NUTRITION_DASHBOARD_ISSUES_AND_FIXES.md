# Nutrition Dashboard Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified

### 1. Create Meal Plan Using Gemini AI Not Working

**Problem**: The "Create Meal Plan" button on the dashboard was not properly connected to the comprehensive nutrition service that includes Gemini AI integration.

**Root Cause**: 
- The dashboard buttons were trying to use `window.dashboardAI.generateMealPlan()` which only provides basic AI text generation
- The comprehensive `window.nutritionService.generateMealPlan()` with full cultural adaptation, dietary restrictions, and structured meal planning was not being utilized
- Missing proper integration between dashboard UI and the nutrition service

**Symptoms**:
- Clicking "Create Meal Plan" either did nothing or showed basic text instead of structured meal plans
- No cultural cuisine preferences
- No dietary restriction handling
- No proper meal plan storage and tracking

### 2. View Recipes Not Working

**Problem**: There was no proper recipe viewing functionality integrated with the dashboard.

**Root Cause**:
- No "View Recipes" button existed on the dashboard
- No integration to extract recipes from existing meal plans
- No recipe generation using AI services
- No recipe storage and management system

**Symptoms**:
- No way to view individual recipes from meal plans
- No recipe collection or management
- Missing detailed recipe generation with AI

### 3. View Plans Not Working

**Problem**: The "View Plans" functionality was not properly connected to the nutrition service's meal plan storage and retrieval system.

**Root Cause**:
- Dashboard was using localStorage directly instead of the nutrition service's comprehensive data management
- No proper meal plan display with cultural notes, adherence tracking, and nutritional guidelines
- Missing integration with the nutrition UI component for full meal plan visualization

**Symptoms**:
- Clicking "View Plans" showed empty or basic data
- No cultural adaptation information
- No adherence tracking
- No proper meal plan management interface
